In this post we discuss the most interesting bits from our recent paper on [Discovering Neural Wirings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00586). Primarily, the connectivity patterns of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are manually defined or largely constrained. A recent [critique](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11786-6) argues that this is in contrast with the brain, as _"...animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them to learn very rapidly."_
