I'm an incoming PhD student at the University of Washington, where I will be working with Professor [Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).
I am interested broadly in Machine Learning.

I am currently wrapping up a wonderful year as part of the [PRIOR Group](https://prior.allenai.org/) at the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/)
under the supervision of [Roozbeh Mottaghi](https://cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/). At AI2 I have also received mentorship from [Mohammad Rastegari](https://allenai.org/team/mohammadr/),
[Kiana Ehsani](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kianae/) and [Ali](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Brown University. For my [senior
honors thesis](/publications/#undergraduate-thesis) I was advised by [Kavita Ramanan](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/kavita-ramanan).
During undergrad I completed internships at Facebook (advised by [Yannis Kalantidis](http://www.skamalas.com/)) & Microsoft.
